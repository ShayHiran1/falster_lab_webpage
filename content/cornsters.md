I aim to run a stimulating and supportive lab, that give members regular opportunities to engage with each other. Participation in lab activities is expected of all lab members.

The "Cornsters" are members of the joint lab groups of Assoc Prof Daniel Falster & Assoc Prof Will Cornwell. Together, we have a weekly lab meeting and occasional social outings.

## Weekly lab meetings

We meet each week to discuss the latest research and ideas in ecology and evolution. The style of meeting changes from week to week. Here is our current schedule:

## Past lab outings

### 2019 Christmas bushwalk

To celebrate the end of 2019, the lab went for a bush walk in [Botany Bay National Park](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Botany+Bay+National+Park/@-33.9831423,151.2489387,15.87z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x6b12b5ae86ad0895:0x8c7debb3a8a06e6!8m2!3d-33.9927325!4d151.2493908), just 10km south of UNSW.

### 2019 writing retreat 

In May 2019, we were hosted by Cornster Casey Gibson in her home town of Wingello, for a productive 2-day writing retreat. In amongst the writing, we enjoyed some tasty mushrooms, picked in [Wingello State Forest](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Wingello+State+Forest/@-34.7028886,150.0424295,11z/data=!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x6b13f49e42f1f331:0x40609b490439260!2sWingello+NSW+2579!3b1!8m2!3d-34.6900752!4d150.1551898!3m4!1s0x6b13f53c8593318d:0xf0609b573ff0b40!8m2!3d-34.733078!4d150.1817751).
