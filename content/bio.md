I grew up in beautiful Sydney, surrounded by tall trees, and otherwise on camping trips, hikes, or on my grandfathers farm. At school I developed a passion for maths. My current research and teaching combines three great passions: biology, maths, and coding. While I still live in Sydney, I've spent time living abroad in Norway and Austria, and also visiting researchers in France, Panama and the USA.

## Education

- PhD, Macquarie University Australia (2010)
- MSc, Macquarie University Australia (2003)
- BSc, UNSW Australia (2000)

## Summary of research outputs

**Articles**: > 50 articles in leading international journals such as *Nature*, *PNAS*, *Trends in Ecology \& Evolution*, *Biological Reviews*, *New Phytologist*, *Methods in Ecology \& Evolution*, *Journal of Ecology*.

**Citations**: > 1000 total citations, > 700 citations yr$^{-1}$, H-index of 32 [Google Scholar].

**Datasets**: Leading new compilation "[AusTraits](http://traitecoevo.github.io/austraits.build/): curated plant trait database for the Australian flora"; previously produced global compilations: [Biomass and Allometry Database](https://github.com/dfalster/baad), the [Coral Traits Database](coraltraits.org).

**Software**: I have produced and made publicly available important software packages used in over 900 publications, including the statistical [SMATR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/smatr/index.html) and the growth model, [plant](https://traitecoevo.github.io/plant/).

**Reproducible science**: I am making my publications entirely reproducible, enabling others to reproduce, adapt, apply and extend my results.

# Research highlights

**Global shift towards trait-based ecology**: Enabled global quantification and comparison of plant strategies via four leading traits (Westoby *et al* 2002, 2256 cites) and quantifying trade-off in how plants function (e.g. Falster *et al* 2003, 409 cites, Zanne *et al* 2010, 290 cites).

**How traits influence plant growth**: New process-based models from my group show traits impact on growth (Falster *et al* 2011, 2018) and mortality (Camac *et al* 2018) of trees across diverse species.

**Trait-based community assembly**: My work shows how tradeoffs in plant function mediate species coexistence and how we can predict trait mixtures from first principles (Falster *et al* 2017, 33 cites).

**Global rules of plant competition**: Using growth data from > 3 million trees in plots across the world, Kunstler *et al* 2016 (345 cites) shows how functional traits influence competitive interactions.

**Unified understanding of plant construction**: Created world's largest database on plant allometry (Falster *et al* 2015, 73 cites), improving estimates of Australian carbon stocks (Paul *et al* 2016, 57 cites).
