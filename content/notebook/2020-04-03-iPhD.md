**(Note: this opportunity is now closed.)**

I'm excited to call for applications for this project modelling long-term outcomes of carbon farming projects, and associated economic risks induced by climate change, particularly changes in seasonal rainfall.


**Application close:** April 3, 2020

**Eligibility:** Australian/New Zealand Citizens and Australian Permanent residents.

**Full details:** https://research.unsw.edu.au/industry-phd/projects/landscape-dynamics-of-regenerating-forests-predicting-climate-change-impacts-on-0

The project is in collaboration with our industry partner [Climate Friendly](http://climatefriendly.com), together with CSIRO's [Dr Keryn Paul](https://people.csiro.au/P/K/Keryn-Paul) & [Dr Stephen Roxburgh](https://people.csiro.au/r/s/stephen-roxburgh), and UNSW academics [Dr Daniel Falster](http://danielfalster.com) and [Prof Andy Pitman](https://www.ccrc.unsw.edu.au/ccrc-team/academic-research/andy-pitman).

Benefits of this program include:

- A 4 year program, including a minimum 6 month industry internship,
- $40K per annum scholarship,
- An elite industry-focused research program,
- Three-way support system by UNSW, CSIRO and an Industry Partner.

Carbon-farming projects that promote natural regeneration in degraded semi-arid landscapes drive changes in landscape condition at huge scales, offering an unparalleled opportunity to answer ecological questions that improve our stewardship of Australian ecosystems while delivering direct economic benefits. Climate Friendly and partners collectively manage more than 4 million hectares of regenerating mulga forests. Intensive monitoring tracks regeneration on individual properties, but synthesising diverse datasets across property, regional, and national scales has proven challenging. Studying regeneration at scale is needed to understand the interactions between climate and landscape condition, and how carbon stored in these landscapes is impacted.

Feel free to contact Daniel for further discussion.
