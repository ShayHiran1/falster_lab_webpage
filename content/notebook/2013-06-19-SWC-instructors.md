In preparation for running a "software carpentry bootcamp" I participated in the Software Carpentry Foundation (SCF)'s ["Instructor training course"](https://software-carpentry.org/pages/join.html#instructors).  The course takes 2-4 hours/week for 12 weeks and covers the basics of educational psychology, instructional design, and how to apply both to teach programming to adults. These two posts contain some reflections on my experience from the course, the first on a lesson about [repeating thing](https://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2013/06/reflections-repeating-things/), and the second [on the course as a whole](https://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2013/06/reflections-on-the-software-carpentry-teaching-module/).
