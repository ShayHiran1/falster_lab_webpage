Our latest paper describes an R package called [plant](https://github.com/traitecoevo/plant) -- an individual-based simulation model that simulates the growth of individual trees, stands of competing plants, or entire metacommunities under a disturbance regime, using common physiological rules and trait-based functional trade-offs to capture differences among species. 

Falster DS, FitzJohn RG, Brännström Å, Dieckmann U, Westoby M (2016) plant: A package for modelling forest trait ecology & evolution. *Methods in Ecology and Evolution* 7: 136-146. doi: [10.1111/2041-210X.12525](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.12525), code: [github](https://github.com/traitecoevo/plant_paper).

Our paper appeared as part of a [cross-journal special feature](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/subject/code/000046/homepage/cross_journal_special_feature.htm) highlighting the interdisciplinary potential of demography, with articles spread among all six journals of the British Ecological Society.

I also presented in a [joint webinar](https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/publications/latest-news/webinar-demography-beyond-the-population/) accompanying the special issue.
