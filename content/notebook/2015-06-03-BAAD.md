In [this post on the ropensci blog](https://ropensci.org/blog/2015/06/03/baad/)
we discuss some of the challenges we had to overcome in combining
 data from 176 different scientific studies to the [Biomass And
Allometry Database (BAAD)](https://github.com/dfalster/baad), recently
published as a [data paper](https://www.esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E096/128/)
in the journal Ecology.
